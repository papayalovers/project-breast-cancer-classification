# Breast Cancer Classification Project
Welcome to the Breast Cancer Classification Project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on various features extracted from diagnostic images.

# About the Project
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis play crucial roles in improving patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze diagnostic data and assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

# Goals
1. Develop a robust machine learning model for accurate classification of breast tumors.
2. Enhance early detection capabilities to improve patient prognosis and treatment planning.
3. Contribute to the ongoing efforts in leveraging technology for healthcare advancements.
# Features
1. Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for classification.
2. Incorporates feature engineering and selection techniques to identify relevant diagnostic features.
3. Implements cross-validation and performance evaluation metrics to ensure model reliability and generalization.
